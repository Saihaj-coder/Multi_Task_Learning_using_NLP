# Multi-Task NLP model using LSTM

* Multi-task learning (MTL) is a machine learning approach where a model is trained simultaneously on multiple related tasks!

Libraries used ---> 

* Numpy, Pandas, maltplotlib, Scikit-learn, nltk, tensorflow, seaborn

Datasets --->

(i) Emotion Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/emotions

(ii) Violence Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/gender-based-violence-tweet-classification?select=Train.csv

(iii) Hate Speech Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/hate-speech-and-offensive-language-dataset

Components --->

(i) Individual Inputs:
* Multi-Task model accepts input for each task individually.

(ii) Individual Outputs:
* Multi-Task model generates output for each task individually

(iii) Shared Core Layers:
* Multi-Task models functionality is that a single model can do multiple related tasks. To exhibit this functionality the core layers of the model like (Embedding, LSTM, pooling, dropout etc) are shared among all the tasks and are not separately available for them

Tasks ---> 

* (i) Task 1: Emotion detection
* (ii) Task 2: Violence detection
* (iii) Task 3: Hate speech detection
